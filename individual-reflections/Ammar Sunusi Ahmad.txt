Working on the Canvas Drawing App project has been a very meaningful experience for me, both technically and personally. As the group leader, I took responsibility for organizing our workflow, assigning tasks, and ensuring that everyone in the team understood their role. I coordinated our meetings, set deadlines, and followed up on progress so that we stayed on track. I also contributed directly to the coding aspect of the project, especially in integrating the model, tools, and user interface into a working application.

One of my key contributions was when our paint tool was not saving properly. I worked closely with my team to research possible solutions, tested multiple approaches, and finally implemented the fix that made the paint functionality persistent. This experience taught me patience and the importance of breaking down problems step by step instead of getting overwhelmed.

Through this project, I gained practical knowledge of Python, Tkinter, and object-oriented programming. I also learned about teamwork, leadership, and communication. Guiding the group made me realize that good leadership is not about doing everything alone but about supporting, motivating, and guiding others toward success. This project improved both my technical and leadership skills.
