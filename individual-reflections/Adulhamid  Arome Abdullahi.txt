Working on the Drawing Canvas App project was both challenging and rewarding. At the beginning, I had little to no knowledge of Python, Tkinter, or version control with GitHub. This project gave me the opportunity to learn how GUI applications are structured and how different files in a project interact with each other. I gained hands-on experience with concepts like event handling, undo/redo history, saving images using Pillow, and writing unit tests with unittest.

One of the most valuable lessons I learned was the importance of collaboration and version control. Using GitHub as a team allowed us to keep track of changes, assign tasks, and ensure everyone contributed to the repository in an organized way. Although there were challenges, especially with setting up dependencies and running the app, these obstacles pushed me to research, ask questions, and improve my problem-solving skills.

Overall, this project improved my understanding of Python and software development practices. I now feel more confident using libraries, writing tests, and explaining how a program works. It also showed me the importance of teamwork, clear communication, and proper documentation in softwareÂ engineering.
