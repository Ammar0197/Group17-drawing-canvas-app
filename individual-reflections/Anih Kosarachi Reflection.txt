In this project, I focused on setting up the development environment and ensuring smooth package management. I configured pipenv for the team, which allowed us to create a virtual environment and keep dependencies consistent across different systems. Through this, I generated the Pipfile and Pipfile.lock, which helped us track exact package versions and avoid “it works on my machine” issues. I also created demo videos that showcased how the application runs, demonstrating the main features clearly for both our instructor and future users. These contributions ensured that the project was easy to set up, run, and understand.

From this experience, I learned how valuable environment management tools like pipenv are in real-world software development. It showed me the importance of reproducibility, teamwork, and making sure everyone on the team can work in the same environment without version conflicts. Producing demo videos also taught me how to present technical work in a way that is clear to both technical and non-technical audiences. Overall, I strengthened my skills in Python, GitHub collaboration, and project communication. I realized that small but essential tasks, like managing dependencies and creating demonstrations, make a huge difference in the success and usability of a project.
